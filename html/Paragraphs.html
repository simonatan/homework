		<h1>Principles For Clean HTML Code</h1>
		<p style="text-align:left" >
		<b>Beautiful and clean HTML</b> is the foundation of a beautiful website. When I teach people about <b>CSS</b>, I always begin by telling them that good <b>CSS</b> can only exist with equally good HTML markup. A house is only as strong as its foundation, right? The advantages of <b>clean, semantic HTML</b> are many, yet so many websites suffer from poorly written markup.<br></p>
		<p style="text-align:left" >
		<b>Strict DOCTYPE.</b> If we are going to do this, let's just do it right. No need for a discussion about whether to use HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0: both of them offer a strict version that will keep us nice and honest as we write our code.<br><p>
		<p style="text-align:left" >
		<b>Character set & encoding characters.</b> In our < head > section, the very first thing should be the declaration of our character set. We're using <b>UTF-8</b> here, which is swell, but it's listed after our < title >. Let's go ahead and move it up so that the browser knows what character set it's dealing with before it starts reading any content at all.<br></p>
        <p style="text-align:left" >
		The next time you write <b>HTML</b>, be it a small chunk in a huge website, or the beginning of a fresh new project, just do what you can to make it <b>right.</b><br></p>
